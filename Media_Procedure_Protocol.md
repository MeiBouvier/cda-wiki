# Media Interview Procedure & Protocol Guide

### When reporters call:

 - Ask them stuff.
    * What's your angle? What info do you need?
    * Who else are you interviewing?
    * What's your deadline?
 - Notify Civic Data Alliance leadership

### Prepare for interview:
 - Practice your three "messages"
 - Use fascts, figures & anecdotes as support points
 - No jargon. Be brief. Be memorable. Be persuasive.
