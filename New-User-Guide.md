## Introduction

First and foremost, thank you for joining the Civic Data Alliance (CDA) in our mission to put technology and data to work for good! You probably have some questions, and most of them will be answered here. If they are not, you will most likely be able to find the answers in the rest of our documentation, listed [here](/README.md).

## The Civic Data Alliance

### What Is the Civic Data Alliance

The [Civic Data Alliance](www.civicdataalliance.org) is a volunteer organization working to put technology to work for the public good. We host hackathons, provide technology tools, and offer collaborative spaces to create and facilitate innovative projects that utilize technology to assist in solving public problems.

_CDA is a not-for-profit organization, with registered 501(c)3 status through [Code for America]() (CfA)._

#### Choosing a project

We often have many ongoing projects with different teams of volunteers, so you will need to find some project(s) that have ways for you to contribute. Finding out what projects are underway is as simple as checking out the [Civic Data Alliance Organization on Github]() and looking through the list of repositories. Each repository is an individual project that you may be able to contribute to! 

Every project should include documentation with, at a minimum, these included:

* A high-level project description that is _not_ jargon-heavy. This should include some combination of the purpose of the project, the problem it solves, and data sets it utilizes.
* A list of technologies being used in the project.
* At least one point of contact for the project.
* A list of public partners working on the project.
